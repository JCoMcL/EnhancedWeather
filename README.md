# Enhanced Weather

## About

Enhanced Weather is a reimagining of Corosauce's Weather2 Mod. The original Weather2 mod is currently being worked on for 1.18 Forge, however there is no Fabric equivalent. Enhanced Weather solves this problem by creating a Fabric version of the original Weather2 Mod. Most source code in this mod is original with some of Corosauce's code mixed in every one in a while.

## Features

### Wind

Global Winds will flow around the Overworld and Nether. These winds can move the clouds and some particles around (The particle movement can be disabled). As stated above, wind is unfortunately global. I may consider adding local wind systems, but this is a low-priority addition.

### Storms

Enhanced Weather contains a weather system that is very different from the original weather system. Every day there is a 1/15 chance (this is configurable) that either a squall line or an isolated supercell will spawn nearby a random player. These storms are severe, and dangerous to travel through. 
Rain Clouds can also form from water being collected from humid biomes, releasing the water as rain.

### Tornadoes

# Tornadoes have been temporarily disabled in v1.0-Beta4-Alpha1, it will be re-enabled in the near future. Use v1.0-Beta3 if you want tornadoes.

The key feature of this mod! Like in Weather2, Enhanced Weather has tornadoes.
Tornadoes form when a storm gets powerful enough to create a violent funnel cloud.
Tornadoes can pick up entities, though it doesn't destroy blocks yet.

### More Weather is expected to come in later Betas
