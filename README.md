# Enhanced Weather

## About

Enhanced Weather is a reimagining of Corosauce's Weather2 Mod. The original Weather2 mod is currently being worked on for 1.18 Forge, however there is no Fabric equivalent. Enhanced Weather solves this problem by creating a Fabric version of the original Weather2 Mod. Most source code in this mod is original with some of Corosauce's code mixed in every one in a while.

## Features

### Wind

**Animation of Torch Particles moving with the wind**

Global Winds will flow around the Overworld and Nether. These winds can move the clouds and some particles around (The particle movement can be disabled). As stated above, wind is unfortunately global. I may consider adding local wind systems, but this is a low-priority addition.

### Storms

Enhanced Weather has storms systems that work similar to the original Weather2 Mod. Every day, each player has a 1/30 chance of a severe storm spawning, these storms contain violent winds, heavy lightning, and in the future may even have hail & tornadoes.

Rain Clouds can also form from water being collected from humid biomes, releasing the water as rain.

### More Weather is expected to come in later Betas
